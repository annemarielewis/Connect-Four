This is a connect four game with my original code.

Languages used:
html
css
javascript

html:
To save 43 lines of html code, I created an array in JS and, using a for loop, iterated over the array to create divs with the class hole for the holes of the board. I then styled these divs in css along with the board's design.

To create the responsive elements of the game, I used the DOM to call html elements into JS and created event listeners.

The winning logic of the game was the most challenging aspect. I created wining logic in a prior version that was many more lines of code, but then decided to re-assess my approach and refactor. I am happier with the new, current code.

I'd also like to add an AI algorithm so that the user can play against an "oponent" whenever they load the page.

This was my first project using html, css, JS, and the DOM, and I am really excited to continue learning, improving, and creating!
