Expected challenges: I am still getting comfortable with JS functions and logic, so this will be a challenge. Because I'm still getting the hang of it, I'm very excited to continue practicing JS/the DOM through this project!

html:
//create the holes using div elements
//wrap these divs in a div and, to give the holes an outline, create a border around the encapsulating div
//create buttons for "player red" and "player blue"
//create a div for the "X-won" box and set it to hidden

javascript:
//pull the X-won box into the dom
//create a variable for player red (Red)
//create a variable for player (Blue)

//add a elements in the html for arrow cursor over a row when toggled, give class (.arrow), set to hidden
//^bring that element into JS dom
//event listener: when row is toggled, arrow classes becomes visible

//create an event listener when a row is clicked
//when that row is clicked, drop the current player's chip

//css: style appropriately/how would I use a jpeg or png as my board instead? (important question-->investigate)
